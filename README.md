# Sms Broadcast Notification Channel

This package makes it easy to send notifications using [Sms Broadcast](https://www.smsbroadcast.com.au/) with Laravel 8
This is a fork for laravel 8 support, original info below:

It uses my [Sms Broadcast PHP package](https://github.com/atymic/sms-broadcast-php) under the hood.

## Installation

Install the package using composer

```bash
composer require laravel-notification-channels/sms-broadcast
```

Add the configuration to your `services.php` config file:

```php
'smsbroadcast' => [
    'username' => env('SMS_BROADCAST_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('SMS_BROADCAST_PASSWORD'),
    'default_sender' => env('SMS_BROADCAST_DEFAULT_SENDER', null),
]
```

## Usage

You can use the channel in your `via()` method inside the notification:

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use NotificationChannels\SmsBroadcast\SmsBroadcastMessage;
use NotificationChannels\SmsBroadcast\SmsBroadcastChannel;

class AccountApproved extends Notification
{
    public function via($notifiable)
    {
        return [SmsBroadcastChannel::class];
    }

    public function toSmsbroadcast($notifiable)
    {
        return (new SmsBroadcastMessage)
            ->content("Task #{$notifiable->id} is complete!");
    }
}
```

In your notifiable model, make sure to include a `routeNotificationForSmsbroadcast()` method, which returns an australian phone number.

```php
public function routeNotificationForSmsbroadcast()
{
    return $this->phone; // 0412345678 or 6142345678
}
```

### Available methods

`sender()`: Sets the sender's name or phone number.

`content()`: Set a content of the notification message.

`delay()`: Set a delay, in minutes before sending the message

`reference()`: Set the SMS ref code
